# Thyroid Disease

## Your in depth guide to understanding the risk of thyroid disease

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Jorgen85Lex/Thyroid_Disease.git)]

With this project we'll delve deeper into the human body, specifically looking at the thyroid, and gain a better grasp on thyroid disease. 

We'll look at sex, age, TSH/T3/T4/TT4/T4U/etc levels in the blood, and how those factors might indicate a specific diagnosis. 
>The data obtained to help guide us in our data journey is Thyroid Disease Data (Kaggle).

## What is Thyroid Disease?
Thyroid disease is an umbrella term for conditions that affect how your thyroid functions. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are the two main types of thyroid disease. But they each have multiple possible causes. Thyroid diseases are treatable â€” usually with medication.

- Most Common Types of Thyroid Disease are:
    -Hypothyroidism
    -Hyperthyroidism
        >T4 (thyroxine) is typically associated with hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), where the thyroid does not produce enough thyroid hormone. In this case, the thyroid produces insufficient amounts of both T3 and T4. Since T4 is the prohormone, it is usually converted into T3 in the body. A lack of T4 can result in sluggish metabolism, fatigue, weight gain, and other symptoms of hypothyroidism.
   
       T3 (triiodothyronine) is often associated with hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid), because in hyperthyroidism, the thyroid gland produces too much of both T3 and T4. T3 is the more active form of thyroid hormone and has a stronger effect on the body's metabolism. High levels of T3 can lead to symptoms like rapid heart rate, weight loss, and nervousness.
